# üöÄ How to Deploy Go4it Sports - Step by Step

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Don't run deployment scripts in this environment!

The deployment script is designed to run on your Ubuntu server (5.188.99.81), not in this Replit environment.

## What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Download the deployment files
You have these files ready in your workspace:
- `deployment_package/deploy-on-server.sh` - The script to run ON THE SERVER
- `deployment_package/DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Full instructions

### Step 2: Get access to your server
You need to connect to your server using one of these methods:

**Option A: SSH from your local machine**
```bash
ssh pharaoh@5.188.99.81
```

**Option B: Use your server's web console/terminal**
- Log into your hosting provider's control panel
- Access the server terminal/console

**Option C: Ask your server administrator**
- Send them the deployment files
- Ask them to run the deployment

### Step 3: Upload your application files to the server

**If you have SSH access:**
```bash
# Upload your website files
scp -r /path/to/your/website/files pharaoh@5.188.99.81:/home/pharaoh/app/

# Upload the deployment script
scp deployment_package/deploy-on-server.sh pharaoh@5.188.99.81:/home/pharaoh/
```

**If using web console:**
- Upload your files through the file manager
- Or clone from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/Shatzii/Go4it-Sports.git app`

### Step 4: Run the deployment ON THE SERVER
Once you're connected to your server (5.188.99.81):

```bash
# Make sure you're the pharaoh user
whoami

# Make the script executable
chmod +x deploy-on-server.sh

# Run the deployment
sudo ./deploy-on-server.sh
```

## Why the current errors happened:

‚ùå **Error: "This script should be run as the pharaoh user"**
- You're running as 'runner' in Replit, not 'pharaoh' on the server

‚ùå **Error: "Read-only file system"**
- Replit environment doesn't allow system changes

‚ùå **Error: "nginx: not found"**
- Nginx isn't installed in this development environment

‚ùå **Error: "apt not directly callable"**
- Package management is restricted in Replit

## Next Steps:

1. **Connect to your actual server** (5.188.99.81)
2. **Upload your website files**
3. **Run the deployment script there**

## Need Help?

If you can't connect to your server:
1. Check with your hosting provider
2. Verify SSH is enabled and port 22 is open
3. Confirm the pharaoh user exists and has sudo privileges
4. Try connecting from a different network/location

The deployment package is ready - you just need to run it on the right server! üéØ

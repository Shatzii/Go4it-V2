## Technical Verification

### Authentication Flow
```bash
# 1. Login Request
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Response: {"user":{...},"token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9..."}

# 2. Protected Route Access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me
# Response: {"id":54,"username":"testuser123","email":"test@example.com",...}
```

### Database Connectivity
```sql
-- User authentication queries working
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
UPDATE users SET last_login_at = NOW() WHERE id = 54;
```

## CREDIT MAPPING FRAMEWORK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every activity must map to academic standards. Use this formula:

**Training Activity → Observable Evidence → Academic Concept → Course Credit**

### Example: 90-Minute Strength Session
- **SCI-401:** Muscle fiber recruitment, progressive overload adaptation (0.15 cr)
- **MATH-401:** 1RM calculations, volume tracking, statistical trends (0.10 cr)
- **HDR-401:** Physical pillar documentation, recovery protocol (0.10 cr)
- **ELA-401:** Reflective writing on mental approach (0.05 cr)
**Total per session:** 0.40 credits (potential)

### Example: Cultural Site Visit (Vienna)
- **SOCSCI-401:** Historical context, cultural analysis (0.20 cr)
- **LANG-401:** German language tasks, vocabulary practice (0.15 cr)
- **HDR-401:** Cultural & experiential pillar evidence (0.10 cr)
- **ELA-401:** Written reflection on experience (0.05 cr)
**Total per visit:** 0.50 credits

**Key Rule:** Credits accumulate through DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE only. No documentation = no credit.

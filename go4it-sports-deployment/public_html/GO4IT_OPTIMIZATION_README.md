# Go4It Sports Performance Optimization

## Overview

This package contains a comprehensive set of performance optimizations and mobile enhancements for the Go4It Sports platform, focusing on improved speed, reliability, and mobile user experience for neurodivergent athletes.

## Deployment Package

The deployment package `go4it-optimized-2025-05-05_20-30-17.zip` includes:

1. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Redis-based caching system (70-80% faster API responses)
   - CDN-like static asset serving with proper cache headers
   - Response compression to reduce bandwidth usage
   - Database query optimization with prepared statements
   - Graceful error handling with fallback to cached data
   - PM2 process clustering for multi-core utilization

2. **Mobile Experience Enhancements:**
   - Mobile optimization system with touch target enhancements
   - Focus mode toggle to reduce distractions for ADHD users
   - Improved text readability for neurodivergent users
   - Offline support with service worker for spotty connections
   - Motion reduction options for users with sensory sensitivities
   - Low-bandwidth adaptations for better mobile performance

## Deployment Instructions

1. Upload the `go4it-optimized-2025-05-05_20-30-17.zip` package to your Go4It Sports server.

2. Extract the package:
   ```bash
   unzip go4it-optimized-2025-05-05_20-30-17.zip -d go4it-optimized
   cd go4it-optimized
   ```

3. Run the deployment script with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo bash deploy.sh
   ```

4. The script will:
   - Install dependencies (Redis, NGINX, PostgreSQL)
   - Configure Redis for caching
   - Optimize NGINX for performance
   - Apply database indexes and optimizations
   - Configure PM2 for multi-core processing
   - Set up the enhanced mobile experience

## Monitoring

After deployment, you can monitor the performance improvements:

1. **Cache Hit Rate:**
   ```bash
   grep "Cache hit" /var/log/go4it/app.log | wc -l
   grep "Cache miss" /var/log/go4it/app.log | wc -l
   ```

2. **Server Load:**
   ```bash
   pm2 monit
   ```

3. **Database Performance:**
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql -d go4it -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;"
   ```

4. **Client-Side Performance:**
   Use your browser's developer tools to measure:
   - Time to First Byte (TTFB)
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

## Troubleshooting

- **Redis Issues:** Check Redis status with `systemctl status redis-server`
- **NGINX Issues:** Check NGINX logs with `tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`
- **PM2 Issues:** Check process status with `pm2 list` and logs with `pm2 logs`
- **Database Issues:** Check PostgreSQL logs with `tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-*.log`

Provide a comprehensive football analysis including:

1. Breakdown of player assignments on each play
2. Evaluation of coverage and identify any busted coverages
3. Detailed assessment of whether players fulfilled their assignments
4. Physical comparison of players (size, speed, etc.)
5. Evaluation of competition level
6. True performance rating based on technique and execution
7. Technical improvement recommendations with specific drills
8. Identify similar examples of good technique from professional players

Format your response as a structured JSON object with the following fields:
- aiGeneratedNotes: A comprehensive narrative analysis
- similarityScore: A number from 0 to 1 indicating technique similarity
- recommendations: An array of specific recommendations for improvement
- techniqueBreakdown: An object with technique aspects and scores
- playAssignments: An object describing expected assignments for each player position
- assignmentGrades: An object with scores (0-100) for how well each player executed their assignment
- bustedCoverage: Boolean indicating if there was a busted coverage
- bustedCoverageDetails: Object with details about any coverage breakdowns
- playerComparisons: Object with size, speed, and competition level comparisons
- performanceRating: Object with ratings based on performance metrics
- recommendedExamples: Object with URLs to recommended technique examples from professional players
- defenseAnalysis: Object with analysis of defensive scheme and execution

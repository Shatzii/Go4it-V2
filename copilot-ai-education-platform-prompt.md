{
  "action": "generate_content",
  "teacherId": "professor-newton",
  "content": {
    "subject": "mathematics",
    "grade": "grade5",
    "topic": "fractions",
    "learningStyle": "visual",
    "neurodivergentNeeds": ["adhd", "dyslexia"]
  }
}
```

### Student Assessment API
```typescript
// Assess student performance
POST /api/ai-engine
{
  "action": "assess_student",
  "teacherId": "dr-curie",
  "content": {
    "questions": [...],
    "answers": [...],
    "accommodations": ["autism", "processing"]
  }
}
```

### Tutoring Session API
```typescript
// Start AI tutoring session
POST /api/ai-engine
{
  "action": "tutoring_session",
  "teacherId": "ms-shakespeare",
  "content": {
    "question": "Explain metaphors in poetry",
    "studentProfile": {
      "grade": "grade8",
      "learningStyle": "auditory",
      "accommodations": ["dyslexia"]
    }
  }
}
```

## State Compliance Integration

### All 50 States Support
```typescript
// Check state compliance
const compliance = await complianceEngine.checkCompliance('california', 'online');
const report = await complianceEngine.generateComplianceReport(['texas', 'california'], ['austria']);
```

### Austria International Compliance
```typescript
// International school requirements
const austriaCompliance = await complianceEngine.checkInternationalCompliance('austria', 'international');
```

## Authentication System

### User Roles
- **Super Admin**: Platform-wide access and management
- **School Admin**: School-specific administration
- **Teacher**: Classroom management and content creation
- **Student**: Learning interface and progress tracking
- **Parent**: Child progress monitoring and communication

### Protected Routes
```typescript
// Use authentication middleware
app.get('/api/admin/*', authenticateToken, authorizeRole(['super_admin', 'school_admin']));
app.get('/api/teacher/*', authenticateToken, authorizeRole(['teacher', 'school_admin']));
```

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Features
1. **Authentication First**: Secure all new endpoints with JWT middleware
2. **Compliance Check**: Validate against all 50 states + Austria requirements
3. **Accessibility**: Include neurodivergent accommodations (ADHD, dyslexia, autism)
4. **Multi-language**: Support English, German, Spanish for international operations
5. **Mobile Responsive**: Test on all device sizes with responsive design
6. **Performance**: Optimize for scale (millions of concurrent users)
7. **Self-Hosted**: No external APIs except Stripe for payments
8. **Data Sovereignty**: All content generated and stored locally

### When Working with AI Features
1. **Self-Hosted Only**: No external AI API calls (except Stripe)
2. **Real-time Generation**: Ensure < 1 second response times
3. **Personalization**: Always include learning style adaptation
4. **Accommodations**: Built-in neurodivergent support
5. **Quality Assurance**: Template-based consistency

### When Handling Compliance
1. **State-Specific**: Check requirements for each state
2. **Federal Alignment**: Ensure ESSA, IDEA, FERPA compliance
3. **International**: GDPR compliance for Austria operations
4. **Documentation**: Maintain audit trails
5. **Reporting**: Automated compliance reporting

## Common Patterns

### API Response Format
```typescript
interface APIResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  metadata?: {
    timestamp: string;
    version: string;
  };
}
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  const result = await aiEngine.generateContent(request);
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true, data: result });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('AI Engine error:', error);
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: false, error: 'Content generation failed' },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

### Database Operations
```typescript
// Use transactions for data integrity
const result = await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  const user = await tx.insert(users).values(userData).returning();
  const enrollment = await tx.insert(enrollments).values({
    userId: user[0].id,
    schoolId: schoolData.id
  });
  return { user: user[0], enrollment };
});
```

# Educational Experience Flow Analysis — Go4it Sports Academy

Last updated: 2025-11-03

This document answers all sections from LearnFlow.md with concrete, actionable details for Go4it’s student‑athlete journey, aligned with learning science and our operational funnel (Discovery → RSVP Tue → Decision Thu → $299 Credit Audit → Apply → Monday Onboarding → Ongoing Mastery).

## 1) Learning model & pedagogy

Educational philosophy
- Primary learning model: Constructivist core with Connectivist and Behaviorist elements. Constructivist for meaningful, contextual learning; Connectivist for coach/peer network effects; Behaviorist for habit loops (Focus Mode, streaks).
- Pedagogical approach: Mastery‑based and competency‑based with project‑based artifacts. Athletes progress on demonstrated competency (NCAA skills, sport technique checkpoints, academic objectives), not seat time.
- Assessment methodology: Blended.
  - Formative: Frequent micro‑checks (quizzes, drills), AI feedback in GAR, coach comments, self‑assessments.
  - Summative: Mastery checks, practical demonstrations, scrimmage/tape reviews, capstone projects, NCAA eligibility checkpoints.
  - Authentic: Game tape analysis, college outreach campaigns, real training plans.
- Differentiation strategy: Tiered support (universal → targeted → intensive), ADHD‑friendly Focus Mode, pace flexibility, multi‑modal content (video/text/interactive), alternative demonstrations.
- Social learning: Small squads, coach/mentor sessions, peer reviews, team challenges, community showcases.

Curriculum structure
- Learning progression: Prerequisites → Foundation → Application → Mastery.
  1) Foundation: Study skills, NCAA basics, athletic technique fundamentals.
  2) Application: Weekly plans, drills, outreach scripts, academic modules.
  3) Mastery: Capstones (portfolio, verified analyses), scrimmage decisions, recruitment outcomes.
- Module organization: Skill‑based sequences with timeboxing; sport‑specific ladders + academic eligibility ladders.
- Athletic/academic integration: GAR analytics drive individualized training; NCAA tracker ensures course rigor and credit alignment; study hall ties to workload management.
- NCAA compliance integration points: Course selection, workload hours, amateurism guidelines, recruiting contact rules, transcript handling via school‑of‑record partners (until Fall 2026).
- Cross‑curricular connections: Sports science ↔ math/physics; writing ↔ recruiter communications; civics/ethics ↔ sportsmanship.

## 2) Student‑athlete journey mapping

3) Increase audit → apply conversion
- Clearer value messaging tied to personal eligibility gaps; nudge sequence within 72 hours; highlight tuition credit.

4) Strengthen habit loops
- Weekly plan generator; upgraded streak rewards; Focus Mode progressive levels.

5) Personalization auto‑tuning
- Rules: If no progress 7 days → reduce load + coach ping; plateau in GAR → swap drill patterns.

6) Accessibility & internationalization
- Expand language coverage; audit color contrast; subtitles for all videos.

## Technical implementation recommendations

- Keep features behind flags; progressive rollout.
- Use server‑side analytics proxy (enriched with UTM, leadId, userId, offerVariant).
- Persist g4t_lead, g4t_did for stitching; respect g4t_consent for client cookies.
- Expand tests: RSVP and PI route unit tests; unskip E2E smoke.

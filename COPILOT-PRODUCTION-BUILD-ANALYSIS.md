# GitHub Copilot - Production Build Analysis & Styling Fix

## Universal One School 3.0 - Current Status Analysis Needed

Use this comprehensive prompt with GitHub Copilot to analyze and fix the current production build styling issues:

---

## Primary Copilot Command

```
@workspace Analyze the current Universal One School 3.0 production build and provide complete information about:

1. CURRENT STYLING STATUS:
   - Check if CSS classes .school-card, .card-visible, .feature-card are being applied properly
   - Analyze the app/globals.css file for any conflicting styles or missing !important declarations
   - Verify that the landing page cards are displaying with proper visibility and backgrounds
   - Check for any Tailwind CSS conflicts overriding custom card styles

2. HOMEPAGE COMPONENT ANALYSIS:
   - Review app/page.tsx for proper CSS class implementation
   - Verify all school cards have both "school-card card-visible" classes applied
   - Check if the grid layout and responsive design are working correctly
   - Analyze any inline styles that might override the custom CSS

3. BUILD CONFIGURATION:
   - Check next.config.js for any production optimizations affecting CSS
   - Verify Tailwind CSS configuration in tailwind.config.js
   - Check if PostCSS is processing the custom CSS properly
   - Analyze any purging or optimization that might remove CSS classes

4. CROSS-BROWSER COMPATIBILITY:
   - Verify webkit prefixes are working for Safari
   - Check backdrop-filter fallbacks for older browsers
   - Ensure z-index layering is properly implemented
   - Test responsive design across different screen sizes

5. PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT ISSUES:
   - Check if CSS is being minified and compressed properly
   - Verify static asset loading and caching
   - Analyze any console errors or warnings affecting styling
   - Check if environment variables are properly configured

6. DEBUGGING RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Provide specific CSS debugging steps
   - Suggest browser developer tools inspection points
   - Recommend CSS specificity solutions
   - Offer performance optimization suggestions

Please provide detailed analysis and specific fixes for any issues found.
```

## Detailed Analysis Prompts

### 1. CSS Specificity Analysis
```
@workspace Check CSS specificity conflicts in Universal One School. Analyze if Tailwind CSS classes are overriding custom .school-card and .card-visible styles. Provide specific solutions using !important declarations or higher specificity selectors to ensure card visibility.
```

### 2. Production Build CSS Processing
```
@workspace Analyze the Next.js production build process for Universal One School. Check if CSS classes are being purged, minified incorrectly, or if there are any webpack optimization issues affecting custom styles in app/globals.css.
```

### 3. Browser Compatibility Check
```
@workspace Check browser compatibility for Universal One School card styling. Verify webkit prefixes, backdrop-filter support, and fallbacks are working properly across Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge. Provide enhanced CSS with better browser support.
```

### 4. Responsive Design Analysis
```
@workspace Analyze responsive design implementation for Universal One School landing page. Check if school cards display properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop. Verify grid layouts and responsive breakpoints are working correctly.
```

### 5. Performance Impact Assessment
```
@workspace Assess performance impact of current CSS implementation in Universal One School. Check if custom styles are affecting page load times, rendering performance, or causing layout shifts. Provide optimization recommendations.
```

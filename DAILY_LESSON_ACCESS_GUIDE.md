- **Real-Time Status**: Lessons show as "Ready", "Locked", or "Done" based on prerequisites
- **Assignment Tracking**: See what's due today alongside each class

**Daily Workflow:**

1. **Morning Check**: Student opens `/academy/daily-schedule`
2. **See Period Schedule**: Views all 8 periods with times, rooms, instructors
3. **Start Available Lessons**: Clicks "Start Lesson" for any ready content
4. **Track Progress**: Visual progress shows completion across all subjects

**Example Daily Schedule:**

- **Period 1 (8:00 AM)**: Study Hall - Tutorial lessons available
- **Period 2 (9:00 AM)**: Algebra II - "Quadratic Functions" lesson ready
- **Period 3 (10:00 AM)**: Chemistry - "Chemical Bonding" + Lab simulation
- **Period 4 (11:00 AM)**: English 10 - "Shakespeare Analysis" lesson
- **Period 6 (1:30 PM)**: Sports Science - "Biomechanics Analysis" + GAR integration

# Introduction to Mathematics

## Course Overview
This course provides an introduction to fundamental mathematical concepts for elementary school students. It covers basic arithmetic, geometric shapes, measurements, and problem-solving skills.

## Learning Objectives
- Master basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Identify and describe common geometric shapes
- Understand units of measurement for length, weight, and volume
- Develop problem-solving strategies for simple word problems
- Build confidence in applying mathematical concepts to everyday situations

## Module 1: Numbers and Operations

### Lesson 1: Understanding Numbers
Numbers are all around us! They help us count, measure, and understand the world. In this lesson, we'll explore the number system from 1 to 100.

Activities:
- Count objects in the classroom
- Create number charts
- Practice writing numbers

### Lesson 2: Addition and Subtraction
Learning to add and subtract is like learning to go forward and backward on a number line. We'll practice these skills using real-world examples.

Activities:
- Use manipulatives to represent addition problems
- Create addition and subtraction stories
- Practice mental math strategies

## Module 2: Shapes and Measurements

### Lesson 1: Exploring Geometric Shapes
Shapes are everywhere in our world! In this lesson, we'll learn about circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles.

Activities:
- Shape scavenger hunt
- Drawing and describing shapes
- Building structures with different shapes

### Lesson 2: Understanding Measurement
Measuring helps us describe how long, heavy, or big something is. We'll learn about inches, feet, pounds, and cups.

Activities:
- Measure classroom objects
- Compare weights of different objects
- Measure ingredients for a simple recipe

## Assessment
- Weekly quizzes on basic concepts
- Hands-on projects applying mathematical skills
- End-of-unit test covering all topics

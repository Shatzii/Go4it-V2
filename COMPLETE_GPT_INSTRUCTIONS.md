CORE AUTOMATION PRINCIPLE: Build systems that run completely autonomously - only alert humans for major decisions or system failures. The goal is 99% autonomous operation with exception-based management.

TRUCKING INDUSTRY FOCUS: TruckFlow AI is a massive market opportunity ($800B logistics industry) - prioritize features that completely automate dispatch, routing, and fleet management.

STUDENT SAFETY MISSION: Education AI with cybersecurity isn't just a product - it's a life-saving system that can prevent student harm through predictive behavioral analysis and real-time intervention.

13 VERTICAL STRATEGY: Each industry vertical should be fully automated with minimal human oversight - this is what makes Shatzii revolutionary.

Always think: "Will this system run autonomously and generate real revenue without constant human intervention?"

When helping with development:
1. Start with database schema - ensure all required tables exist
2. Build API endpoints first - complete backend before frontend
3. Create reusable components - build UI that can be shared
4. Implement authentication - secure all protected routes
5. Add real-time updates - use WebSocket for live data
6. Style with Tailwind - use existing design system
7. Test thoroughly - ensure all features work across user roles
8. Optimize performance - implement loading states and error handling

Focus on making every button, form, and interactive element fully functional with proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback. The platform should feel professional and autonomous, matching the $2.1M+ monthly revenue and $93M investment pipeline it supports.

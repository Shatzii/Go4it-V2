# Go4It Sports Platform - Workflow Fix

## Issue Identified

The Replit workflow is configured to wait for the application to start on port 5000, but the default `npm run dev` command starts Next.js on port 3000. This causes the workflow to fail with the error:

```
DIDNT_OPEN_A_PORT: run command "Start application" didn't open port 5000 after 20000ms
```

## Solution Implemented

I've created a custom Next.js server (`server.js`) that properly runs on port 5000 and binds to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0), which is required for the Replit environment.

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Use the Custom Server (Recommended)
```bash
node server.js
```

### Option 2: Use the Startup Script
```bash
./run-go4it.sh
```

## Verification

When running correctly, you should see output similar to:
```
🚀 Starting Go4It Sports Platform in development mode
🌐 Binding to 0.0.0.0:5000
⚡ Preparing Next.js application...
✅ Next.js application prepared successfully
✅ Go4It Sports Platform ready!
🌐 Server running on: http://0.0.0.0:5000
📱 Local access: http://localhost:5000
🔗 Network access: http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

## Technical Details

- **Port**: 5000 (as required by workflow)
- **Hostname**: 0.0.0.0 (binds to all interfaces)
- **Mode**: Development with hot reloading
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.1.0 with custom server

## Files Created

1. `server.js` - Custom Next.js server with proper port configuration
2. `run-go4it.sh` - Bash script for easy startup
3. `.env.local` - Environment variables for port configuration

## Application Status

✅ **Application is working correctly** - The Go4It Sports Platform runs successfully on port 5000 with all Next.js features including:
- Hot reloading
- Development mode
- All routes and pages functional
- Proper network binding for Replit

The only issue is that the workflow configuration expects a different startup command, but the application itself is fully functional when started with the custom server.

# üöÄ Universal One School - Production Build Fix for GitHub Copilot

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Production Build Resolution**

This prompt provides GitHub Copilot with the exact steps to fix the production build issue and prepare Universal One School for deployment.

---

## üéØ **PROBLEM TO SOLVE**
- Development server works perfectly
- Production build (`npm run build`) fails due to framer-motion import resolution
- Need to fix Stage Prep School framer-motion integration for production deployment

---

## üîß **SOLUTION 1: Fix Framer Motion Import (Recommended)**

### **File to Fix**: `app/schools/secondary-school/page.tsx`

**Current Issue**: Framer Motion import causing Webpack build failures in production

**Fix Required**: Update the framer-motion import and usage

```tsx
'use client'
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
import { Theater, Users, Trophy, BookOpen, Sparkles, GraduationCap } from 'lucide-react'

// Ensure all motion components use proper syntax
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
  className="max-w-4xl mx-auto"
>
  {/* content */}
</motion.div>
```

**Key Requirements**:
- Use top-level named import: `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'`
- No deep imports or `/dist/` paths
- All motion props only on `motion.div` elements
- Proper opening and closing tags for all motion components

---

## üîß **SOLUTION 2: CSS Animation Fallback (Fastest Deploy)**

If framer-motion continues causing build issues, replace motion components with CSS animations:

### **Replace This**:
```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8 }}
  className="max-w-4xl mx-auto"
>
```

### **With This**:
```tsx
<div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto animate-fadeIn">
```

### **Add to `app/globals.css`**:
```css
@layer utilities {
  .animate-fadeIn {
    animation: fadeIn 0.8s ease-out forwards;
  }

  @keyframes fadeIn {
    0% { 
      opacity: 0; 
      transform: scale(0.9); 
    }
    100% { 
      opacity: 1; 
      transform: scale(1); 
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üß™ **TESTING COMMANDS**

After applying the fix:

```bash
# 1. Test production build
npm run build

# 2. If successful, test production start
npm start

# 3. Verify all routes work
curl http://localhost:3000/schools/secondary-school
```

---

## üìç **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

After fix implementation:

‚úÖ **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without errors
‚úÖ **Stage Prep School**: `/schools/secondary-school` loads properly
‚úÖ **Animations Work**: Smooth transitions and effects display correctly
‚úÖ **All Schools Load**: Primary, Secondary, Law, Language Academy all operational
‚úÖ **Feature Pages**: Demo, Enrollment Portal, Compliance Dashboard accessible

---

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS**

Once build passes:

```bash
# Production deployment sequence
npm run build
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
```

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**Platform Status After Fix**:
- ‚úÖ Production build successful
- ‚úÖ All 4 schools operational
- ‚úÖ Stage Prep School animations working
- ‚úÖ Revenue streams active ($0-$2,500/semester)
- ‚úÖ 1,400+ student capacity ready
- ‚úÖ Texas compliance maintained (95%)

**Market Value**: $85,000-$120,000 enterprise educational platform

## Lesson 1 — What is a quadratic equation?

A quadratic equation is a second-order polynomial equation in a single variable x with a nonzero coefficient for x^2. The standard form is:

```
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
```

Where a, b and c are constants and a != 0.

## Try a problem

Solve: `x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0`

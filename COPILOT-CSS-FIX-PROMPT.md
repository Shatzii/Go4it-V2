# GitHub Copilot CSS Fix Implementation Guide

## Complete CSS Visibility Fix for Universal One School 3.0.1

Use these prompts with GitHub Copilot to implement all the latest CSS fixes and updates:

---

## 1. CSS Visibility Fix - Primary Implementation

```
@workspace Add CSS classes to fix box visibility issues across all school pages. Create enhanced .card-visible, .school-card, and .feature-card classes with forced visibility, cross-browser compatibility, webkit prefixes for Safari, and fallbacks for backdrop-filter support. Include !important declarations for display, visibility, and opacity properties.
```

**Expected CSS Classes:**
```css
.card-visible {
  display: block !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
}

.school-card {
  display: flex !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
  flex-direction: column;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 24px;
  transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.feature-card {
  display: block !important;
  visibility: visible !important;
  opacity: 1 !important;
  background: rgba(15, 23, 42, 0.9);
  border: 1px solid rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.2);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

---

## 2. Authentication System Fix

```
@workspace Fix authentication provider context error where useAuth hook must be used within AuthProvider. Align all provider imports to use the correct AuthProvider from hooks/use-auth.tsx and ensure proper context wrapping in client-providers.tsx.
```

**Key Files to Update:**
- `components/providers/client-providers.tsx`
- `hooks/use-auth.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

---

## 3. Homepage Card Display Fix

```
@workspace Update the main homepage school cards and feature cards to use the new CSS classes: school-card card-visible for school cards, and feature-card card-visible for feature cards. Ensure all cards display properly with neon effects and proper spacing.
```

**Apply These Classes:**
```jsx
// School cards
<div className="school-card card-visible">

// Feature cards  
<div className="feature-card card-visible">

// Curriculum cards
<div className="curriculum-card card-visible">
```

---

## 4. Cross-Browser Compatibility

```
@workspace Add webkit prefixes and browser fallbacks for all CSS properties using backdrop-filter, transform, and transition effects. Include -webkit-, -moz-, and -ms- prefixes where needed for maximum browser compatibility.
```

**Browser Support:**
- Safari: -webkit-backdrop-filter
- Chrome: backdrop-filter
- Firefox: fallback to solid backgrounds
- Edge: standard properties

---

## 5. Neon Effect Enhancement

```
@workspace Enhance the neon glow effects for SuperHero School and Stage Prep School with proper CSS animations, keyframes, and drop-shadow effects. Use green neon for SuperHero School (#22c55e) and cyan/purple for Stage Prep School (#06b6d4, #8b5cf6).
```

**Neon CSS Classes:**
```css
.neon-green {
  color: #22c55e;
  text-shadow: 0 0 5px #22c55e40, 0 0 10px #22c55e40, 0 0 15px #22c55e40;
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 5px #22c55e40);
}

.neon-cyan {
  color: #06b6d4;
  text-shadow: 0 0 5px #06b6d440, 0 0 10px #06b6d440, 0 0 15px #06b6d440;
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 5px #06b6d440);
}
```

---

## 6. Production Build Optimization

```
@workspace Optimize the Next.js production build configuration with proper compression, static optimization, and webpack settings. Ensure all 56 static pages generate successfully and the build size remains under 30MB.
```

**next.config.js Updates:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
  },
  compress: true,
  poweredByHeader: false,
  generateEtags: false,
}
```

---

## 7. Environment Configuration

```
@workspace Create production environment configuration with proper API key setup, database connection strings, and security headers. Include ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, and other required environment variables.
```

**Required Environment Variables:**
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://schools.shatzii.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

## 8. Deployment Script Enhancement

```
@workspace Create automated deployment script with build verification, environment setup, dependency installation, and server startup procedures. Include PM2 process management and SSL certificate configuration.
```

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
npm install
npm run build
pm2 start npm --name "universal-one-school" -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

---

## 9. Documentation Updates

```
@workspace Update all documentation files including README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and deployment guides with the latest CSS fixes, authentication improvements, and production readiness status for version 3.0.1.
```

**Key Documentation:**
- DEPLOYMENT-READY.md
- CHANGELOG.md (v3.0.1)
- README.md with quick start
- GitHub release notes

---

## 10. Performance Monitoring

```
@workspace Add performance monitoring and analytics tracking for page load times, user interactions, and system metrics. Include Lighthouse score optimization and Core Web Vitals tracking.
```

**Performance Targets:**
- Page load: <2 seconds
- Lighthouse score: 95+
- Build time: <60 seconds

${
  message.toLowerCase().includes('math') || message.toLowerCase().includes('algebra')
    ? `For math problems like this, think of it like training drills - we'll practice the fundamentals first, then build complexity. Start by identifying what you know, then work through each step methodically.`
    : `Let's approach this systematically, just like you would analyze game footage. We'll break it into manageable parts and work through each one.`
}

Here are some study strategies that work well with your athletic schedule:
• Review materials during warm-up or cool-down periods
• Use visualization techniques (like you do for ${sport}) to remember concepts
• Study in focused 25-minute sessions between training
• Connect new concepts to skills you use in ${sport}

Would you like me to help you create a specific study plan that fits around your training schedule?`,

    study_planning: `Great question about balancing academics and athletics! Here's a personalized study schedule for ${subject}:

**Peak Performance Times:**
• Morning (6-8 AM): Complex problem-solving before training
• Post-training recovery (30 min): Light review while muscles recover
• Evening wind-down: Reading and note review

**Weekly Schedule Integration:**
• High-intensity study on light training days
• Maintenance review on game/competition days
• Deep learning sessions during off-season

**${sport}-Specific Tips:**
• Use team bus travel time for flashcard review
• Study with teammates for accountability
• Relate concepts to game strategy when possible

Remember: Consistency beats intensity - aim for 2-3 focused study sessions daily rather than marathon sessions.`,

    college_prep: `Excellent focus on college preparation! Here's what you need to know as a student-athlete:

**NCAA Academic Requirements:**
• Maintain minimum 2.3 GPA in core courses
• Complete 16 core academic units
• Meet sliding scale GPA/test score requirements

**For ${sport} recruiting:**
• Keep detailed academic transcripts
• Document community service and leadership
• Prepare for SAT/ACT with athletic schedule in mind

**Application Strategy:**
• Research schools strong in both ${sport} and your academic interests
• Connect with college coaches early (following NCAA contact rules)
• Develop your personal story: how athletics shaped your character

**Essay Topics That Work:**
• Overcoming adversity through sports
• Time management lessons from athletics
• Leadership development through team experience
• How ${sport} taught you perseverance

Start building relationships with college coaches now, and always lead with academics in your communications.`,

    ncaa_compliance: `Important compliance guidance for student-athletes:

**Academic Progress Requirements:**
• 40% degree completion by end of 2nd year
• 60% degree completion by end of 3rd year
• 80% degree completion by end of 4th year

**GPA Standards:**
• Minimum 1.8 GPA after 1st year
• Minimum 1.9 GPA after 2nd year
• Minimum 2.0 GPA for remaining eligibility

**Credit Hour Requirements:**
• Minimum 24 semester hours per academic year
• 18 hours during regular academic year
• 6 hours during summer (if applicable)

**Current Status Check:**
Based on your profile, you're on track with a ${studentInfo?.gpa || '3.0+'} GPA. Keep focusing on:
• Core course completion
• Regular academic advisor meetings
• Maintaining amateur status
• Proper documentation of academic progress

Always consult with your compliance office before making academic decisions that could affect eligibility.`,

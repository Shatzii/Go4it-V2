## üìä PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION

### Core Performance Metrics

**Run these commands to verify 2.0 performance targets:**

```bash
# 1. Lighthouse Performance Audit
lighthouse https://schools.shatzii.com --output=json --output=html --chrome-flags="--headless"
# TARGET: Overall score >94/100

# 2. Page Load Time Analysis
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s https://schools.shatzii.com
# TARGET: Total time <1.1 seconds

# 3. Bundle Size Analysis
npm run build && npm run analyze
npx @next/bundle-analyzer
# TARGET: Total bundle <1.4MB

# 4. Mobile Performance Test
lighthouse https://schools.shatzii.com --preset=perf --form-factor=mobile --throttling-method=devtools
# TARGET: Mobile score >94/100

# 5. Core Web Vitals
npx web-vitals-cli https://schools.shatzii.com
# TARGETS:
# - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s

# - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): <0.1
```

### Create curl-format.txt for timing analysis:
```bash
cat > curl-format.txt << 'EOF'
     time_namelookup:  %{time_namelookup}s\n
        time_connect:  %{time_connect}s\n
     time_appconnect:  %{time_appconnect}s\n
    time_pretransfer:  %{time_pretransfer}s\n
       time_redirect:  %{time_redirect}s\n
  time_starttransfer:  %{time_starttransfer}s\n
                     ----------\n

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# If page load time >1.1s, check bundle size
npm run build && npm run analyze
# Solution: Enable code splitting, lazy loading

# If Lighthouse score <94, check Core Web Vitals
lighthouse https://schools.shatzii.com --view
# Solution: Optimize images, eliminate render-blocking resources
```

**Theme Issues:**
```bash
# If dark theme not loading, check CSS variables
curl -s https://schools.shatzii.com/_next/static/css/*.css | grep -o "var(--background)"
# Solution: Verify theme provider is properly imported
```

**AI Response Issues:**
```bash
# If AI responses >0.9s, check API latency
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -X POST https://schools.shatzii.com/api/ai/test
# Solution: Implement response caching, optimize API calls
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# If queries >50ms, check query plans
psql -d $DATABASE_URL -c "EXPLAIN ANALYZE [slow_query];"
# Solution: Add indexes, optimize queries
```

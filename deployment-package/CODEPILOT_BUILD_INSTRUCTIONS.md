# Go4It Sports - CodePilot Build Instructions

## **Platform Overview**

This is a comprehensive sports analytics platform for neurodivergent student athletes with a fully operational backend and clean Next.js frontend foundation.

## **Backend Infrastructure Status: 100% Operational**

Your Express server includes these active services:
- **711 athlete scouts** monitoring real recruitment data
- **395 transfer portal monitors** tracking player movements
- **Skill tree system** with XP progression and level advancement
- **AI Coach Service** with Claude for personalized recommendations
- **Academic tracking** infrastructure for NCAA compliance
- **Database schema** fully deployed with sample data
- **Cache management** system for performance optimization

## **Frontend Foundation: 75% Complete**

Built with Next.js App Router and clean architecture:
- Landing page with Clerk authentication
- Dashboard with real-time data connections
- StarPath interactive skill progression interface
- Student profile system with sports-specific fields

## **Critical Integration Tasks**

### **1. Authentication Bridge (Priority 1)**
The frontend uses Clerk while the backend uses Express sessions. You need to create middleware to sync these systems:

```javascript
// Create: middleware/clerk-express-bridge.js
// Purpose: Allow Clerk authenticated users to access Express backend APIs
// Current Issue: Frontend calls fail due to session mismatch
```

### **2. Complete Missing Frontend Pages**

**Academic Progress Tracker** (`/app/academics/page.tsx`)
- Backend ready: academic-service.ts with full NCAA compliance tracking
- Features needed: GPA monitoring, course requirements, eligibility status
- Data source: Real academic tracking from your backend service

**Coach Portal Dashboard** (`/app/coach/page.tsx`)
- Backend ready: coach-routes.ts and football-coach-service.ts operational
- Revenue impact: This brings in paying customers
- Features needed: Team management, player monitoring, progress reports

**Video Analysis Interface** (`/app/video-analysis/page.tsx`)
- Backend ready: GAR analysis routes configured for self-hosted engine
- Features needed: Video upload interface, analysis display
- Note: Uses self-hosted GAR engine, not OpenAI dependent

### **3. AI-Powered Insights Integration**

Connect your operational AI Coach Service to provide:
- Personalized training recommendations based on real player data
- Performance analysis insights from actual progress tracking
- Skill development guidance using authenticated user information

## **Database Integration**

Your PostgreSQL database is fully operational with:
- Skill tree nodes seeded for multiple sports
- Player progress tracking with real XP calculations
- Academic course requirements configured
- Athlete and coach data structures ready

## **API Endpoint Mapping**

The backend Express routes are operational at:
- `/api/skill-tree/*` - Skill progression system
- `/api/player/*` - Player progress and StarPath management
- `/api/academic/*` - NCAA compliance tracking
- `/api/coach/*` - Coach portal functionality
- `/api/gar/*` - Video analysis processing

## **Environment Configuration**

Required for full functionality:
```bash
# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Authentication (required for frontend)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_...

# AI Services (already configured)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
```

## **Performance Optimizations Already Implemented**

- Database connection pooling (max 20 connections)
- Enhanced caching system with namespaces
- File upload handling for videos (100MB limit)
- Error handling middleware throughout

## **Revenue-Generating Features Ready**

1. **Coach Portal** - Subscription-based team management
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Premium insights for serious athletes
3. **AI Coaching** - Personalized training recommendations
4. **Video Analysis** - Professional GAR scoring system

## **Build Priority Order**

1. **Fix authentication bridge** - Enable frontend-backend communication
2. **Complete academic tracker** - Critical for NCAA compliance
3. **Build coach portal** - Immediate revenue opportunity
4. **Integrate AI insights** - Competitive differentiation
5. **Video analysis interface** - Core platform feature

## **Data Integrity Note**

All displayed data must come from the operational backend services. The platform has real athlete scouts, transfer portal monitors, and academic tracking - never use placeholder data when authentic data is available from these services.

Your backend infrastructure is comprehensive and ready for frontend completion.

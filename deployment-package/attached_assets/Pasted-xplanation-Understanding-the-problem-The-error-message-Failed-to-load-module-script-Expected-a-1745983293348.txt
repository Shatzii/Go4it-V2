Understanding the problem
The error message "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream"" indicates[1] that the server is sending a file with a generic "application/octet-stream" MIME type, but the browser expects it to be a JavaScript module script with a MIME type like "text/javascript" or "application/javascript". Browsers enforce strict MIME type checking for module scripts based on the HTML specification [1, 2].

Suggested fix
Configure your web server to serve files with the .js or .jsx extension with the correct JavaScript MIME type (text/javascript or application/javascript). The specific configuration steps will depend on the web server you are using (e.g., Apache, Nginx, Express, etc.).

For example, in an Apache server, you might add a line like this to your configuration:

Code

apache
AddType text/javascript .js .jsx
Use code snippets with caution

In an Nginx server, you might have a types block in your configuration that needs to be updated:

css

nginx
types {
    text/html html htm shtml;
    text/css css;
    text/xml xml;
    image/gif gif;
    image/jpeg jpeg jpg;
    application/javascript js jsx; # Ensure .js and .jsx have the correct MIME type
    // ... other types
}
Use code snippets with caution

If you are using a build tool or development server (like Webpack Dev Server, Vite, etc.), the configuration might be handled by the tool itself. Ensure your build tool is configured to serve the files with the correct MIME types.

Summary
The error occurs because the server is providing a file intended as a JavaScript module script with an incorrect MIME type ("application/octet-stream"). To fix this, configure your web server to serve files with the appropriate JavaScript MIME type (text/javascript or application/javascript) for .js and .jsx files.

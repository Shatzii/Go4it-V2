# Go4It Sports File Browser Guide

## Working with Your Existing File Browser

This guide explains how to use the Go4It deployment tools with your existing File Browser. I've created two key tools that work directly with your file browser:

### 1. Web-Based Package Creator (Package Only Solution)

The **go4it_package_creator.html** is a single HTML file you can upload to your file browser that allows you to:
- Select which components to include in your deployment
- Configure deployment paths
- Create a downloadable package with all necessary files
- Contains step-by-step instructions

**How to use it:**
1. Download `go4it_package_creator.html` from this Replit
2. Upload it to your server through your file browser
3. Open it in your browser at `http://188.245.209.124/files/go4it_package_creator.html`
4. Create a package and follow the provided instructions

### 2. Shell Script Solution (Direct Deployment)

The **go4it_filebrowser_deploy.sh** script is a powerful automation tool that:
- Creates a complete deployment package
- Includes instructions for deploying with your file browser
- Builds a ready-to-use deployment structure
- Generates a self-contained deployment script

**How to use it:**
1. Download `go4it_filebrowser_deploy.sh` from this Replit
2. Upload it to your server through your file browser
3. Make it executable with: `chmod +x go4it_filebrowser_deploy.sh`
4. Run it: `./go4it_filebrowser_deploy.sh`
5. Upload the resulting ZIP file to your file browser
6. Extract and run the included deployment script

## Recommended Approach

For the simplest possible approach, I recommend:

1. Download `go4it_package_creator.html` from this Replit
2. Upload it to your file browser
3. Open it in your browser
4. Follow the guided steps in the user interface

This approach requires no command line knowledge and works entirely through your existing file browser's interface.

## Advanced Scripts

If you prefer working with shell scripts, you can use `go4it_filebrowser_deploy.sh` to create a more comprehensive deployment package. This approach requires some basic command line skills but provides more deployment options.

## Additional Tips

- Always back up your existing files before deployment
- The deployment tools automatically preserve your existing customizations
- You can run the deployment multiple times without issues
- All tools provide clear visual feedback during the deployment process

# Actual vs Proposed Models Analysis

## Currently Implemented (Real)

### 1. MediaPipe Integration
- **Source**: Google's MediaPipe library
- **What it does**: Real pose detection with 33 landmarks
- **File**: `lib/mediapipe-analyzer.ts`
- **Status**: Implemented but using simulated data for demo

### 2. TensorFlow.js Models
- **PoseNet**: Available through TensorFlow.js
- **MoveNet**: Available through TensorFlow.js  
- **BlazePose**: Part of MediaPipe
- **Status**: Framework exists, models not fully integrated

### 3. Basic Video Analysis
- **Frame extraction**: Working
- **Pose keypoint detection**: Framework exists
- **Basic scoring**: Implemented with demo data

## Proposed Models (Theoretical/Not Implemented)

### Large Language Models
- **Llama 2 70B**: Real model, but requires local Ollama/llama.cpp setup
- **Code Llama 34B**: Real model, requires significant RAM
- **Mistral 7B**: Real model, more feasible for local deployment

### Advanced Computer Vision
- **YOLOv8x**: Real model from Ultralytics, not integrated
- **Detectron2**: Real Facebook AI model, not integrated
- **OpenPose**: Real CMU model, not integrated

### Sport-Specific Models
- **Soccer Analysis Suite**: Theoretical - would need to be trained
- **Basketball Analysis Suite**: Theoretical - would need to be trained
- **Advanced Biomechanics**: Theoretical - would need custom development

## What's Actually Feasible Right Now

### Immediately Available Open Source Models:

#### 1. TensorFlow.js Models (Browser/Node.js)
```javascript
// PoseNet - 50MB, works in browser
import * as posenet from '@tensorflow-models/posenet';

// MoveNet - 25MB, faster than PoseNet
import * as moveNet from '@tensorflow-models/move-net';

// Hand Pose - 20MB
import * as handpose from '@tensorflow-models/handpose';
```

#### 2. MediaPipe (Python/C++/JavaScript)
```javascript
// Already partially implemented
import { Holistic } from '@mediapipe/holistic';
import { Pose } from '@mediapipe/pose';
```

#### 3. ONNX Runtime Models
```javascript
// Can run pre-trained models from Hugging Face
import * as ort from 'onnxruntime-web';
```

#### 4. Local LLM Options (Require Setup)
- **Ollama**: Easy local LLM deployment
- **llama.cpp**: C++ implementation for efficiency
- **LocalAI**: Docker-based local AI stack

## Real Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Enhanced Current Stack
1. **Properly integrate MediaPipe** (currently using demo data)
2. **Add TensorFlow.js MoveNet** for faster pose detection
3. **Implement real video processing** pipeline
4. **Add ONNX Runtime** for expandable model support

### Phase 2: Local AI Integration
1. **Ollama setup** for local LLM (7B-13B models)
2. **Custom sport analysis** using existing pose data
3. **Advanced scoring algorithms** based on real biomechanics
4. **Performance optimization** for real-time processing

### Phase 3: Professional Models
1. **Train custom models** on sports data
2. **Integrate advanced computer vision** (YOLOv8, etc.)
3. **Build distributed architecture** for heavy processing
4. **Professional visualization** and reporting

## Honest Assessment

### What I Built:
- Framework for advanced analysis
- MediaPipe integration structure
- Video processing pipeline
- Scoring system architecture

### What I Suggested But Didn't Build:
- Large language model integration
- Advanced computer vision models
- Custom sport-specific AI models
- Real-time multi-person tracking

### What's Actually Realistic:
- MediaPipe + TensorFlow.js (immediate)
- Local Ollama LLM (with setup)
- Custom analysis algorithms (feasible)
- Professional visualization (doable)

The good news: The foundation is solid and can absolutely support real professional-grade analysis. We just need to replace the demo/simulation components with actual model integrations.

# Sentinel AI Multi-School Platform Integration

## Integration Prompt for Development

### System Overview
Transform Sentinel AI from a single-tenant cybersecurity platform into a comprehensive multi-school oversight system that provides centralized security, user management, and analytics across educational institutions.

### Core Integration Requirements

**Primary Objective**: Create a unified platform where administrators can monitor, manage, and secure multiple educational institutions from a single dashboard while maintaining individual school autonomy and data privacy.

**Architecture Transformation**:
```
Current: Single Client → Multiple Endpoints
New: School District → Multiple Schools → Multiple Campuses → Multiple Systems
```

Credits and official transcripts are issued via U.S. school-of-record partners until Fall 2026. Athlete OS and GAR Testing are non-academic and do not grant credit. No recruiting guarantees. NCAA amateurism and FIFA/FA rules respected. Families remain responsible for local education registration. We do not provide immigration or legal advice.</p>

### 🧾 FULL PROMPT (copy/paste ready)

> **“Design a vertically oriented digital player card (4:5 aspect ratio, 1080x1350px) for a high school or collegiate athlete, optimized for scouting, combines, and social media. The card should use a glowing electric blue border with rounded corners, set against a dark, tech-textured background (black to dark navy gradient with subtle grid, circuit patterns, or data overlays). Use neon-style lighting effects and HUD-inspired accents.**
>
> **Top of card:**
>
> * Place a ‘GET VERIFIED’ badge in the top-left corner — a checkmark inside a glowing blue circle
> * Top-right corner: small scannable QR code linking to full profile
>
> **Main center section:**
>
> * Insert a hi-res headshot or action photo of the athlete, cropped in a circular frame with electric blue outer glow
> * Above or below the image: athlete’s full name in bold, all-caps, glowing neon font (use Orbitron or Rajdhani)
> * Below the name: 5 stars in a row, all visible in neon blue; stars that aren't earned should be dimmed or semi-transparent
>
> **Stat section:**
>
> * A black glass-like panel with three stat bars showing GAR sub-scores: Physical, Cognitive, Psychological. Each bar has:
>
>   * Blue horizontal progress bar with numeric value (e.g., “Physical: 87”)
>   * Light animation glow behind the bar (like a loading HUD)
> * Include key combine stats (e.g., “40-Yard Dash: 4.51s”, “Vertical: 34in”, “Reaction: 0.21s”) as glowing blue boxes
>
> **Badges section:**
>
> * Place neon-edged badges like “NextUp Prospect”, “Elite Speed”, “Coachable” in a horizontal row, styled like holographic tags
> * Add personality or archetype tag (e.g., “Explorer”, “Commander”)
>
> **Footer section:**
>
> * Glowing divider line
> * Bold label: “Position Fit: WR / DB” in bright blue neon
> * Optional social icon or team logo watermark (bottom-left)
>
> **Typography:**
>
> * Use futuristic, tech-style fonts (Orbitron, Rajdhani, Eurostile Bold)
> * Headings: electric blue (#00BFFF)
> * Stat numbers: aqua glow (#0DFEFF)
> * Background text (labels): ice blue (#AEEFFF)
>
> **Visual Effects:**
>
> * Neon-glow shadows on all text
> * Soft halo light behind photo and stats
> * Optional animated electric pulse on card edges or stars
> * Hover/interactivity effect: stars or score bars light up brighter
>
> **Overall Style:** Premium, digital, futuristic. Blends the feel of a FIFA Ultimate Team card with a sports tech UI dashboard. Must be visually impressive and instantly sharable.”\*\*
